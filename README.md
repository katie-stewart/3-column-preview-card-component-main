## My process

This was my first major foray into using CSS grid. The HTML was relatively simple to set up. I used CSS grid to keep all of the sections even and centered. I created a tablet-friendly version as well as a mobile-friendly version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### Useful resources

- [https://wesbos.com/](https://wesbos.com/) - I recommend Wes's free CSS Grid course. It's a great introduction, highly comprehensive.
